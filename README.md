# Next-Water-App ðŸ’§ 

#### recent [july 2024 update] 
* went to fix alignment: the "Life is Water" text, which is now a `<navbar> <h1>` was between the navbar and main container. Objectively it was out of alignment
* UX driven UI ? Wanted to allow page-visitors to see the app without signing up.  
* `<RainyData>` (accuweather API -> check user-input-city|zipcode weather conditions -> `<Weather-Or-Not/>` then `<WheresWater/>` // cheesy wheres-waldo joke
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

#### possible improvements:
* re-integrate google API
* if (username.includes('squid') -> black water drop, pollution theme. /public

* WHOOP (wearable integration) && "Red-Bulb-Temperature | Heat-Dome temps accommodation" && intermittent-fasting (30% of hydration comes from food) accommodation
* fasting app will be created but wishlisty goal: allow `<WaterApp> | <NutritionalSleep>` to consume each other's user data.

{model.users -> useZipCodeOk:boolean} {model.data -> weather} can save accuweather API data in the {model.data}

## A Happy, Healthy Water Cycling App that tracks user/human fluid intake.
#### sidenote: redoing layout adding hero page (1 large scrolling website) or what I'd call 3 amigos format (nav, centersquare, footer)
#### : adding some prototype extension (just learned from a .toString() example that changes (i.e.) 38885 to 38,885. also more `<composition>` if can find need
Dive into the app with this link. ðŸ‘‰ next-water-app.vercel.app
Water App is a Single Page Application with Next, TS, GraphQL, @redux/toolkit, Oauth2.0, JWT, (had redis cache).
The App gathers height, weight, age, and other settings to prepare water cycle intake.
Daily Data is based on Pass/Failing cycles based on: start-time, end-time, notification intensity.
User can then see daily data with react-calendar in /dashboard.
Lastly, the app features AccuweatherAPI data to allow user to check input-specified location weather conditions.

# To Get your Toes Wet with Water App:
#### Repo is here: www.github.com/frankcollins3
* Go to the Repo
* `fork` and `clone` the repo -> `git clone` repo
* npm i for dependencies

# .ENV:
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:fakepassword@localhost:5432/yourDB?connection_limit=Ã·50
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP=CG0C6Jl44486772XhBUOi19659Jl1543LWZGyBP6LkD // fake but similar accuweatherkey

## https://developer.accuweather.com/apis 
// pretty confusing to set up.
1) get a user account key. This will be the NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP
2) If you want to explore with i.e. `"Current Conditions endpoint"`
#### 3) We first need retrieve a key from "Locations API" So this will take 2 promises or async func()
#### 1 func() handler for locations API -> 2 func() handler to access other accuweatherAPI endpoints
