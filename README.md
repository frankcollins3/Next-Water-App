original app sensibly restricts user from seeing any content while approaching the app. 
Want this app to show water-cycle-schedule determining settings bar on <main> page if no user.
User validation will go between input population & data submission

    during FE assignment thought of .toMoney() which takes (i.e):   38885 & (thx chatGPT) returns 38,885. 
    huge motivation to remake this project:     slight personal improvement in web design

the page defaults to new instance of day-correspondent table.waterData upon page load. 
new vesion will create that day-correspondent waterData not at page load but at upon first user-engagement of water cycle

<!-- settings -->
settings "quietly' overwrites settings in the event of duplicate data submission
admittedly the cycle responds immediately to the change so user would know data submission affected the page. 
still would be nice to change the settings bar

ideally put a mini version of that user's water cycling data in the settings panel from which they made changes.
(which would take more space than the current panel allows, hence both elems need dynamic sizing)
settings also because as top explains I want a non-member-page-visitor to see that settings panel without submittability

npm i rechart -> pass in { success: true | false } as 2 data points represented, probably specifically by their <LineChart/> | <AreaChart/>
calendar page also has section with clouds though which connect to accuweather API to return confirmation of user-input-locale-data 

given the clouds and the fact that their <RadialComponent>, I think, with curvature that looks rainbow, if we can somehow:

    cross the concepts of that same page: (conveniently already connecting analytics, the calendar) the icon with clouds
    analytics of pass fail data same data as calendar option to see it on chart, also like to icon_cloud as like to icon_rainbow

calendar today: drip water sign. 
allow settings to seen without login. a schedule of water-cycle-data as well so the user can see app usage, like how ig has (i.e.) w/ phone

This could be your new drip with example data in the beginning.

    asserted by inherited child props and hidde

# Next-Water-App ðŸ’§ 
## A Happy, Healthy Water Cycling App that tracks user/human fluid intake.
#### sidenote: redoing layout adding hero page (1 large scrolling website) or what I'd call 3 amigos format (nav, centersquare, footer)
#### : adding some prototype extension (just learned from a .toString() example that changes (i.e.) 38885 to 38,885. also more `<composition>` if can find need
Dive into the app with this link. ðŸ‘‰ next-water-app.vercel.app
Water App is a Single Page Application with Next, TS, GraphQL, @redux/toolkit, Oauth2.0, JWT, (had redis cache).
The App gathers height, weight, age, and other settings to prepare water cycle intake.
Daily Data is based on Pass/Failing cycles based on: start-time, end-time, notification intensity.
User can then see daily data with react-calendar in /dashboard.
Lastly, the app features AccuweatherAPI data to allow user to check input-specified location weather conditions.

# To Get your Toes Wet with Water App:
#### Repo is here: www.github.com/frankcollins3
* Go to the Repo
* `fork` and `clone` the repo -> `git clone` repo
* npm i for dependencies

# .ENV:
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:fakepassword@localhost:5432/yourDB?connection_limit=Ã·50
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP=CG0C6Jl44486772XhBUOi19659Jl1543LWZGyBP6LkD // fake but similar accuweatherkey

## https://developer.accuweather.com/apis 
// pretty confusing to set up.
1) get a user account key. This will be the NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP
2) If you want to explore with i.e. `"Current Conditions endpoint"`
#### 3) We first need retrieve a key from "Locations API" So this will take 2 promises or async func()
#### 1 func() handler for locations API -> 2 func() handler to access other accuweatherAPI endpoints
