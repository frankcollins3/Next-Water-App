<RainyData> -> "which city" -> React Native | mobile version to say "Drop Pin": water drop since given a chance to liken it to location
click calendar & everything stays the same just change the bar graph don't even change the water drop. panel shows chart showing this week T|F
.btn disabling functionality: cant click unless within 30 mins or so.. right now you can click the whole schedule without being up to pocket
lmaoo don't forget the app enhancing function of letting the user login. 
userSignup -> "New Wave Icon?" even after the user submitted. it should now say -> <WELL...COME> can show a well since water themed.  
<Credits/Footer> water-cycle is over? keep the bottom footer text { opacity: 1.0 }

<!-- considered idea: while the current session is > 60 minutes away zZz (light blue Z animations going up the bar); -->
<Rechart/>

once fasting app created, want the water-app calendar to display the settings at the time when data was submitted

<DesignChanges/>

possibly take out the <Calendar/> link in the navbar. User would click on the timer panel which has the [Y] [N]

<Icons> 
new way of presenting choice to user  -> Search web, wet or pool of files 
boat will now be 1 of the 9 icons and it allows you to bring up the cut. 
<!-- keep tucking UI where it fits like the "water is life" being in navbar not between nav and main container. -->

<!-- first improvement -->
dynamic components because I had intentions to put components where they previously wouldn't have been put:
like: I wanted a non logged in user to be able to see the settings bar
wanted mini version of schedule to be put on landing page (like how ig, tinder have example of app actually being used on landing page)
    dynamic componentry seem least so of hoop-jumping approaches
so technically this is also UX driven UI? we want user to have to anticipate their experience less by demonstrating more of what's in.. on..
<!-- first improvement -->

<!--  -->
original app sensibly restricts user from seeing any content while approaching the app. 
Want this app to show water-cycle-schedule determining settings bar on <main> page if no user.
User validation will go between input population & data submission
<!--  -->

<!-- component | composition -->
    during FE assignment thought of .toMoney() which takes (i.e):   38885 & (thx chatGPT) returns 38,885. 
    huge motivation to remake this project:     slight personal improvement in web design 

Number.prototype.toMetrics() Number.prototype.toImperial() 
<component-composition> 
<!-- component | composition -->

<!-- table.data.create() everyday up on app-load -->
the page defaults to new instance of day-correspondent table.waterData upon page load. 
new vesion will create that day-correspondent waterData not at page load but at upon first user-engagement of water cycle 
    this makes even more sense when you think that the calendar feature emphasizes allowing users a scenic path to READ their own data
    to then force them to write data just because they opened the app. 
<!-- table.data.create() everyday up on app-load -->

<!--  -->
npm i rechart -> pass in { success: true | false } as 2 data points represented, probably specifically by their <LineChart/> | <AreaChart/>
calendar page also has section with clouds though which connect to accuweather API to return confirmation of user-input-locale-data 

given the clouds and the fact that their <RadialComponent>, I think, with curvature that looks rainbow, if we can somehow:

    cross the concepts of that same page: (conveniently already connecting analytics, the calendar) the icon with clouds
    analytics of pass fail data same data as calendar option to see it on chart, also like to icon_cloud as like to icon_rainbow
{rainyDay?}
<!--  -->

drop in (with the bucket) login
dip your toes footer
calendar today: drip water sign. 
allow settings to seen without login. a schedule of water-cycle-data as well so the user can see app usage, like how ig has (i.e.) w/ phone

<!-- animation and component composition  -->
This could be your new drip with example data in the beginning.
<component-composition>
    gray text but the word that is light-blue will change to also display a message:
    "YOUR" -> "new" -> "drip" --------------> "YOUR" -> "new" "YOU" //( !.char(r) )"            the "YOU" same "YOUR" with last char removed
    asserted by inherited child props and hidde

# Next-Water-App ðŸ’§ 
## A Happy, Healthy Water Cycling App that tracks user/human fluid intake.
#### sidenote: redoing layout adding hero page (1 large scrolling website) or what I'd call 3 amigos format (nav, centersquare, footer)
#### : adding some prototype extension (just learned from a .toString() example that changes (i.e.) 38885 to 38,885. also more `<composition>` if can find need
Dive into the app with this link. ðŸ‘‰ next-water-app.vercel.app
Water App is a Single Page Application with Next, TS, GraphQL, @redux/toolkit, Oauth2.0, JWT, (had redis cache).
The App gathers height, weight, age, and other settings to prepare water cycle intake.
Daily Data is based on Pass/Failing cycles based on: start-time, end-time, notification intensity.
User can then see daily data with react-calendar in /dashboard.
Lastly, the app features AccuweatherAPI data to allow user to check input-specified location weather conditions.

# To Get your Toes Wet with Water App:
#### Repo is here: www.github.com/frankcollins3
* Go to the Repo
* `fork` and `clone` the repo -> `git clone` repo
* npm i for dependencies

# .ENV:
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:fakepassword@localhost:5432/yourDB?connection_limit=Ã·50
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP=CG0C6Jl44486772XhBUOi19659Jl1543LWZGyBP6LkD // fake but similar accuweatherkey

## https://developer.accuweather.com/apis 
// pretty confusing to set up.
1) get a user account key. This will be the NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP
2) If you want to explore with i.e. `"Current Conditions endpoint"`
#### 3) We first need retrieve a key from "Locations API" So this will take 2 promises or async func()
#### 1 func() handler for locations API -> 2 func() handler to access other accuweatherAPI endpoints
