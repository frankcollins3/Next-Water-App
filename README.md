# Next-Water-App ðŸ’§ 
## A Happy, Healthy Water Cycling App that tracks user/human fluid intake.
Dive into the app with this link. ðŸ‘‰ next-water-app.vercel.app
Water App is a Single Page Application with Next, TS, GraphQL, @redux/toolkit, Oauth2.0, JWT, (had redis cache).
The App gathers height, weight, age, and other settings to prepare water cycle intake.
Daily Data is based on Pass/Failing cycles based on: start-time, end-time, notification intensity.
User can then see daily data with react-calendar in /dashboard.
Lastly, the app features AccuweatherAPI data to allow user to check input-specified location weather conditions.

# To Get your Toes Wet with Water App:
#### Repo is here: www.github.com/frankcollins3
* Go to the Repo
* `fork` and `clone` the repo -> `git clone` repo
* npm i for dependencies

# .ENV:
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:fakepassword@localhost:5432/yourDB?connection_limit=Ã·50
*  NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP=CG0C6Jl44486772XhBUOi19659Jl1543LWZGyBP6LkD // fake but similar accuweatherkey

## https://developer.accuweather.com/apis 
// pretty confusing to set up.
1) get a user account key. This will be the NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_APP
2) If you want to explore with i.e. `"Current Conditions endpoint"`
#### 3) We first need retrieve a key from "Locations API" So this will take 2 promises or async func()
#### 1 func() handler for locations API -> 2 func() handler to access other accuweatherAPI endpoints
